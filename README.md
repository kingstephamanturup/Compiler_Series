Hey Guys, last time we created a simple compiler for the simple purpose but this one is the advanced version of the last one. We are using lexer for creating a a syntax then we use an abstract binary tree for the breaking down of the code that the user inputs then we also use a parser to check if the syntax of the user input is correct or no then at the end we use a code generator for generating the code.
