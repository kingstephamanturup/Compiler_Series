Hey Guys, last time we created a simple compiler for the simple purpose but this one is the advanced version of the last one. We are using lexer for creating a a syntax then we use an abstract binary tree for the breaking down of the code that the user inputs then we also use a parser to check if the syntax of the user input is correct or no then at the end we use a code generator for generating the code. 
There are some files that have been repeated eg. main1,main2,main3. So the last file is the updated one and the rest of the files are for understanding the process for creating the latest file.
